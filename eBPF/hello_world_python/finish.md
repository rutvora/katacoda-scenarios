In this example, you learned how to say "Hello World" in eBPF, and that's a great start!  
More examples with more involved code will come up in the future. Stay Tuned.

You can also start exploring eBPF by yourself and reach out to me if you find something interesting about it.
Hope you enjoyed this!
